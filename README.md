This repo includes simulations for discrete scheduling, to use:

*discrete scheduling simulation.py* is mainly and originally used for simulation. To use it:
- *schedule_list* includes vertices
- *rate()* returns rate vector
- *plot()* can plot surfaces and point clouds

*ds_simu_cellular.py*, *ds_simu_4link_tri.py* specifically to solve the rate region of cases: cellular network, line network with 4 links and triangle cases

*schedule_graph_library.py* and txt files includes the cycles we've found for different cases. It is time consuming to find them, so I record them for our easier lives.
